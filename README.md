# Description

-This is a web application project to create a Tenant application in which tenants can be able to register and upload their profile pictures so that other tenants in the same apartment/rental can be able to know who their neighbours are.
-This app is intended to help increase security among tenants living in the rentals and also create a sense of of community living among the tenants.

# Technologies used:

# Behavior Driven Development:

1.Under the navbar,
-Clicking the Feedback will take you to another page where you can give your contact details or any other queries.

2.On the homepage,
 -a user is able to login if he/she has an account already or they can click register to create an account.
 -after login in a user is directed to the profiles of other tenants.

3.After creating an account a user can now be able to view their profile and give their feedback if necessary.
